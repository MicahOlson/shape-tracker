## Description
_Practice: Shape Tracker_  
Lessons 3–18 walk students through creating **production** and **development enviroments** using `npm` to install and manage JavaScript packages, **module bundling** with `webpack` configured through `webpack.config.js` and extended by various **webpack loaders** and **plugins**, `package.json` to manage dependencies, `.gitignore` to exclude redundant files and directories, like `node_modules/` and `dist/`, from being pushed to GitHub, and the incorporation of other tools like `html-webpack-plugin` to manage linking scripts, running a live **development server** with `webpack-dev-server`, using **source maps** for debugging, and **linting** with `eslint` configured through `.eslintrc`. These lessons also discuss JavaScript `import` and `export` statements.  
  
Lessons 41–42 further discusses a project's structure, refactors object constructors and prototypes to **ES6 classes**, demonstrates use of a setup test function, `beforeEach()`, to **DRY** our tests, and applies **template literals**.
